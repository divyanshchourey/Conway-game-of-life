# Conway’s Game of Life 🌱

A web-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life — a fascinating cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. This project is built using **HTML and CSS** as part of the Skill Laboratory coursework at **Shri G.S. Institute of Technology & Science, Indore**.

## 📜 Game Overview

Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The simulation runs on a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. The game evolves in steps based on the following rules:

### Rules:

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
3. **Death**:
   - A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
   - A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).

## 🎮 Components

- **Marketplace**:  
  Buy/sell in-game items that enhance the experience. Transactions are handled through a virtual currency system.

- **Play Button**:  
  Starts the simulation of Conway's Game of Life.

- **Exit Button**:  
  Safely exits the simulation without data loss.

- **Rule Book**:  
  In-game documentation detailing how the simulation works, initial setup, and evolution patterns.

## ⚙️ Additional Features

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:  
  Perform quick actions to streamline gameplay and interaction.

- **Cheats**:  
  Enter special codes to alter simulation parameters such as speed, grid size, or even add special cell patterns.
